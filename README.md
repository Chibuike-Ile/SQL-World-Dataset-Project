## Title: SQL-World-Dataset-Project.

### Aim: This is a Demographic Analysis On Scenario Cases such as 

Country with Highest Life Expectancy, 

Cities with Population Larger than 2000000, 

Most Populated City, and so on.

**This is a Group Project**

Data Source: **Just IT**

The Database was provided by **Just IT.** We then create and configure a Database on mySQL Workbench.

About five of us made up the group.  As a team, we approach each scenario case one at a time.  It was an excellent chance to collaborate with others and share knowledge.
